# Smart-Solution-Iot- an ongoing project

the main purpose of this project is to convert homes to smart one
by using sensors and microcontrollers to manage all home appliances<br/>

we started by a singel sensor to read and controll electricity 
consumption and allow user to know his daily monthely electricity
consumption<br/>

this backend code provide a method to link the server with the following<br/>

- mqtt server to talk to the sensors 
- socket.io to notify user with important information about his appliances
- mongoDB database to keep record of users and applicances data
- redis database for caching purposes
- restApi endpoints to integrate with both mobile apps or other front end apps
